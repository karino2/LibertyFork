# This is a database of connections. Stones of color 1 are
# regarded as connected. Notation: k means a stone of color
# 2 which can be captured. m means a miai pair: it must be
# checked using readlad1 that if each player occupies one
# of these positions, then a connected shape results.

# After this, some supplementary information in the format
# :trfno,libdefect
#  
# Here trfno is the number of transformations of the pattern to
# consider, usually 8, or 4 (if the pattern has a symmetry).
# libdefect is the ``liberty defect.'' When the two groups
# are combined, the effective number of liberties is the sum
# of the two liberties, minus libdefect.
